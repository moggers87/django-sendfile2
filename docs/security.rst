Security
========

If you find a security issue with django-sendfile2, email `security@moggers87.co.uk
<security@moggers87.co.uk>`__. If you want to send an encrypted report, then
please use key id 0x878B5A2A1D47C084.

django-sendfile2 follows the same security reporting model that has worked for other
open source projects: If you report a security vulnerability, it will be acted
on immediately and a fix with complete full disclosure will go out to everyone
at the same time.
